I believe attending the Smartsheet Engage conference in Seattle this October would be a valuable opportunity for professional development. I'm particularly interested in learning how Smartsheet can help us improve our current practices, one example is managing numerous trackers for various tasks. I believe the conference will provide insights into standardizing and upgrading our workflows, and I'm eager to share that knowledge with the team upon my return. 
My commitment to this field extends beyond the workplace; I've been independently pursuing a Project Management Associate Degree since September 2022, which I will complete in March 2025. To further enhance my skills, I'd like to attend the pre-conference training on Introduction to Smartsheet and Project Management on October 7, 2024.

The training cost includes developing and improving skills through instruction and practice, including after the initial 4 day training.. This training cost will also include a monthly session for the cohort, creating a community of practice for 6 months with additional 9 and 12 month final check ins to troubleshoot and fine tune the practice of MI. 

In order to best serve our community, we will discuss with the trainer the importance of leading with a racial equity lens while conducting the training. Motivational interviewing is a way of engaging clients in a change process they lead. Beginning with curiosity and encouraging the client to set the goals of an engagement can help to decrease the power differential many BIPOC people feel when applying for or receiving services from the government. 

We will be inviting ADVSD staff in lead worker roles who can provide mentoring to their teams of case managers/adult protective service investigators. We will outreach to Behavioral Health staff who more frequently work with older adults, across the many teams within the Behavioral Health Division (including Older Adult Behavioral Health, Tri-County 911, PATH, CHOICE, Post-Commitment).

The training will offer continuing education credits in MHACBO or NASW, which is supportive to folks who are required to have a credential or license. This training is in response to requests from folks who work with older adults and have identified the need to increase their skills to support the older adults to change their course of action. Many older adults in our community have a great deal of resilience; however, they also have many years of repeating similar actions and achieving similar outcomes, which do not serve their long term goals or holistic wellness. Motivational interviewing is a great skill for staff to work with these older adults who have behavioral health needs so the older adult can create change.

",Yes,Union Staff/Represented Staff,"We are requesting funding for up to 15 staff, across Health Department- Behavioral Health and Department of County Human Services- Aging Disability Veteran Services Division (ADVSD). The cohort would include at least 5 staff from Behavioral Health Division. Our team, Older Adult Behavioral Health, works across these groups and we have observed how older adults with behavioral health needs are served by both of programs within Multnomah County; therefore older adults with behavioral health needs will directly benefit if we are able to train staff from both areas.

Hi Andrew,

I've been working on scheduling Dr. Joy DeGruy to provide a 4hr training BHD wide, as per the BHWi approval I received several months ago. As part of my communication with her booking agent, I requested the following (which I've asked of all other trainer) in order to be able to apply for NASW and MHACBO CEU's:

    List learning objectives of training
    Describe how the training topic is of importance to social workers and human service practitioners
    Describe how the content is current and of sufficient depth to warrant graduate level credit
    Identify the credentials and demonstrated competency in the field of the presenter
    Agenda with time-stamps
    At least three references used for the training
    A a copy of your syllabus for this training

Today I received a response from the booking agent that they are ""unable to accommodate the request for continuing education credits at this time due to time constraints"".

I know that I committed to providing CEU's when I asked BHWi for the $14000 for the workshop. Should I cancel the booking altogether since they're not able to partner with us in this way? 

Including Jessica in case Division Leadership is invested in me following through on this - was going to host her on June 18th.",,,,,

Step One:
STAR-T
Secondary Trauma Activates Resilience Training
Level One Skills Based Training Full Day Training Offered to All
Employees in Groups of 20 - 25
This basic skills training provides the foundation and skills to
integrate these concepts as prevention skills for secondary trauma
and the building of resilience in the work setting. This is a pre-
requisite for the follow up Deeper Dive, Advanced Skills Training

This is a one-day training, provided in an off-site location with
Multnomah County contracting separately for venue, and
appropriate lunch and refreshment for participants.
To train staff we would offer this one-day training, five days, either
consecutive days in one week or spread out over the end of a week
and the beginning of the next week.
Participants: Up to 25 participants per training day
Facilitators: 2 co-facilitators
Tuition Cost: $2,500.00 per one day training x 5 days = $12,500.00

Facilitator Travel Expenses 2,200.00 x 2 (estimate for airfare, lodging,
ground transportation, per diem) = $4,400.00
Total Cost Step One $ 16,900.00

Step Two:
STAR-T
Secondary Trauma Activates Resilience Training
Level Two Deeper Dive Training in Leading Resilience Skills
Practice Groups in the Organization
This is a 2.5-day training prepares agency personnel to provide
regular RSPG groups inside of the organization. The leadership of
a skills-based group is done with two new Multnomah County co-
facilitators working within their own teams or across the agency to
strengthen the shared nervous system of the organization with
group level resilience work. This shifts responses to trauma
engaged practice out of the realm of self-care and into the zone of
collaborative resilience building.
Participants: 20- 25 people who would commit to running RSPG
groups on a monthly basis. Priority enrollment for
individuals in the organization who have shown engagement and
interest after the level one training.

Facilitators: Two co-facilitators
.
The first 2.5 Day Training to be scheduled ideally 4 – 6 weeks after
the completion of the Level One Basic Skills Training
A second follow up 2.5-day training to be scheduled 6 - 7 months
after the completion of the initial training. The purpose of the
follow up is to reinforce the practice skills and build increased
capacity after participants have had an opportunity to practice
leadership.
Tuition Cost: $ 7,125.00 x 2 trainings = 14, 250.00
Facilitator Travel and Expenses $2,200.00 x 2 x 2 trainings = $ 8, 800.00
(estimate for airfare, lodging, ground transportation, per diem)
Total Cost Step Two = $ 23,050.00

Step Three 
STAR-T
Online Based Follow Up Group Training and Coaching for Facilitators
After the initial Deeper Dive Training, it is helpful for the new
Multnomah County Facilitators to have online support, training and
coaching in the form of group supervision or dyadic supervision.
This is often provided as pre-briefs and debriefs as the facilitators
practice their new skills inside the organization.
